## Project: Handwritten digit Recognition

### Project Overview

For this project,I used one-vs-all logistic regression and neural networks to recognize handwritten digits (from 0 to 9). Automated handwritten digit recognition is widely used today - from recognizing zip codes (postal codes)on mail envelopes to recognizing amounts written on bank checks. The project is completed using Matlab.

### Dataset description

The dataset is a subset of MNIST database. Each example is a 20 x 20 grayscale representation of the digit .Each pixel is represented by
floating point number indicating grayscale intensity at that location .The 20x 20 grid of pixels are unrolled into a 400-d vector .Each of these training examples is a row in our data set .There are 4000 rows in the training set and 1000 rows in the test set .The dataset is normalized.
